# lightweightGltfViewer
This project is an exercise. It is not intended to be used in production.  
Implementing gltf viewer from scratch. No libraries.  
To build you only need to compile the typscript files https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html

Project is running here (unless I didn't deploy latest version, or didn't pay for the hosting :) )
